This workshop provides an introduction to demographic modelling, through different approches, including inferences of effective population sizes (smc++ & GONE), as well as the Approximate Bayesian Computation approach implemented in DILS.
Main instructor: Thibault Leroy (thibault.leroy_at_inrae.fr)

Note 1: Whenever possible, please use the "practical_demo.github.rmd" file. While the PDF version is easier to read (and can definitively be used), it has certain limitations when it provides code to run. At least, if something doesn't work with the PDF version, please have a look at the associated "github.rmd" file.

Note 2: the R scripts that will be used during the practical thanks to the "Rscript [script.R]" function are also available here, in case you would like to use them under Rstudio on your own computer.
In case you enconter any problems downloading the results from DILS from the physalia-cluster, you could download one or few tar.gz files also here (https://github.com/ThibaultLeroyFr/SeqApiPop_WGShoneybeeDataReanalysis/tree/main/DILS_analysis/DILS_allgenome), ideally preferentially download those with "noSFS" and "constantNe".
